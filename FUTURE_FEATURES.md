# Future Game Features & Ideas

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Neural Network Control**: Upgrade from simple physical evolution to neural network brains (sensors for distance, speed, angle) controlling torque/active suspension.
- **Interactive Obstacles**: Moving platforms, crushers, fans, anti-gravity zones.
- **Different Fitness Goals**:
  - *Speed Run*: Fastest time to X meters.
  - *Airtime*: Maximum time spent in air without crashing.
  - *Payload*: Carry a heavy object as far as possible.
  - *Climbing*: Vertical wall scaling capabilities.
- **Resource Management**: Fuel or battery life, requiring efficient movement.

## World & Environment
- **Procedural Track Generation**: Infinite tracks with varying difficulty (Biome based: Desert dunes, Ice friction, Mud slogs).
- **Weather Systems**: Rain (low friction), Wind (force vectors), Fog (visual only).
- **Destructible Terrain**: Cars can dig or break obstacles.

## Multiplayer & Social
- **Ghost Racing**: Race against the best recorded runs from other players or previous generations.
- **Tournaments**: Bracket-style face-offs between top cars.
- **DNA Sharing**: Export/Import car strings to challenge friends' designs.

## Visuals & Polish
- **Car Customization**: Paint jobs, decals (evolved or purchased).
- **Replay System**: Save and watch replays of best runs with camera controls.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Detailed graphs of mutation effects, species diversity heatmaps.

## New Part Types
- **Thrusters/Rockets**: Burst speed at cost of stability.
- **Sticky Wheels**: For wall climbing.
- **Glider Wings**: For extended airtime.
- **Active Suspension**: Pistons that expand/contract based on triggers.
